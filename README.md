# JavaScript Fundamentals

JavaScript was initally created to "make web pages alive".

The Programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page's HTML and run automalically as the page loads.

Scripts are provided and exectued as plain text. They don't need special preparation or comi√ßation to run.

JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript Engine.

The broswer has an embedded engine sometimes called a "JavaSCript Virtual Machine".

Different engines have different "codenames". For example:

V8 - In Chrome, Opera and Edge
SpiderMonkey - in Firefox..
